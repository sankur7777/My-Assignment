    "\n",
    "Ans. A relative path refers to a location that is relative to a current directory. Relative paths make use of two special symbols, a dot (.) and a double-dot (..), which translate into the current directory and the parent directory. Double dots are used for moving up in the hierarchy."

The main difference is that read() will read the whole file at once and then print out the first characters that take up as many bytes as you specify in the parenthesis versus the readline() that will read and print out only the first characters that take up as many bytes as you specify in the parenthesis. You may want to use readline() when you're reading files that are too big for your RAM."
