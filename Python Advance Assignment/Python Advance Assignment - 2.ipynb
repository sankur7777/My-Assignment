    "Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A Python class is like an outline/blueprint/mold for creating a new object. An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working through the code. Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is initiated from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas in Python, Modules are simply files with the . py extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program. In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions/Classes that you want to include in your application."

    "Q2. How do you make instances and classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: For creating a class instance. we call a class by its name and pass the arguments which its __init__ method accepts.\n",

    "   Example: vishwak = employee('Male',20000), Here vishwak is an instance of class employee with attriubutes 'Male' and        20000.\n",

    "   Whereas for creating a class, we use the Class keyword. Class keyword is followed by classname and semicolon.\n",

    "Ans.  Class attributes or Class level Attributes belong to the class itself. these attributes will be shared by all the           instances of the class. Hence these attributes are usually created/defined in the top of class definiation outside         all methods."

    "Q4. Where and how are instance attributes created?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Instances attributes are passed to the class when an object of the class is created. Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are not shared by all objects of the classs. instead each object maintains its own copy of instance attributes at object level. whereas incase of class attributes all instances of class refer to a single copy. Usually instance attributes are defined within the __init__ method of class\n",
